    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods / Random Forest Classifier:\n",
    "- Real-world application:\n",
    "  - One real world application of using a random forest classifier to make predictions can be found over at the [R-Blogger Site](https://www.r-bloggers.com/predicting-wine-quality-using-random-forests/), where writer Teja Kodali details how many factors (such as alcohol content and sugar) can be used to predict wine quality\n",
    "- Strengths of the model:\n",
    "    - Random forests are very accurate, computationally inexpensive, and can handle both binary and numerical data\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "    - While random forests are certainly less prone to overfitting than decision trees, it's still something to keep in mind, and they often still overfit. Also, as with other ensemble methods, random forest classifiers have a much higher memory footprint, as they construct a bunch of other models and let them vote.\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate\n",
    "  - Because of the amount of binary data in our dataset (103 features, most of which are binary), decision trees make a very good candidate. However, this amount of features puts a decision tree at risk of overfitting the data. To mitigate these errors due to variance, we can introduce some more sophistication and use a random forest classifier instead of just one decision tree. By breaking the features down into smaller overlapping decision trees and letting them vote, we reduce the risk of overfitting the data, but still can use the amount of binary data in our dataset to our advantage.\n",

    "Ensemble Methods / AdaBoost Classifier:\n",
    "- Real-world application:\n",
    "  - One real world application of using AdaBoost Classifiers is [real time object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework)\n",
    "- Strengths of the model:\n",
    "  - Adaboost classifiers rarely overfit the data, as they rely on a sophisticated voting system. They are also a highly adaptive classifier that requires little tuning of hyper parameters and can be applied to many situations, however are best applied to deducing a binary dependent variable.\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "  - Adaboost classifiers can be overly sensitive to noisy data, and can have slower training times.\n",
    "- Good candidate bc:\n",
    "  - One of the things AdaBoost does best is predicting a binary dependent variable, which is exactly what we want to do. They are highly adaptable, and often can find nuanced relationships over a large number of features (which we have). This makes it a very strong candidate for our dataset. The only thing to keep an eye out for are a potentially high training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "- Real-world application:\n",
    "  - One real world application of using logistic regression as a binary classifier is the TRISS (Trauma Injury and Severyity Score) method. This uses \"anatomic, physiologic, and age characteristics\" to determine if a patient will survive a severe injury. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3106646)\n",
    "- Strengths of the model:\n",
    "  - Logistic regression classifiers have high interpretability, require far less parameter tuning, and are computationally very performant while training as a result of requiring a small amount of data to train.\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "  - Logistic regression classifiers are subject to high bias and underfitting the data\n",
    "- Good candidate bc:\n",
    "  - Logistic regression classifiers are very good, and often used for, applications with a binary dependent variable (as we have in our data set). They are very performant, require little tuning, and while they are subject to bias, it's still a good candidate to test. "

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

While its performance computationally wasn't nearly as good as Logistic Regression, it had the highest accuracy and F score on the testing set and it is generally used for binary classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that there was seemingly no correlation between the number of data used in the testing set and the AdaBoost's computational performance when predicting. This is very good as we need not fear, once trained, the model prediction taking longer than half a second on larger data sets. This is contrasted with both the Random Forest Classifier and the Logistic Regression which, despite performing better than the AdaBoost Classifier, did have predicting times trending upward as dataset size increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost having the longest training time is a tradeoff we're willing to make for higher accuracy, F score, and a prediction time that doesn't scale with data size. The AdaBoost Classifier's performance on the testing set along with its general use in binary classification lead me to suggest it for the task of identifying individuals that make more than $50,000."

    "We have chosen the AdaBoost Classifier. It breaks the predicting down into a bunch of smaller decision makers. Each of these decision makers doesn't see the whole picture, but they're very good at a specific thing. When it comes time to ask this model \"does this individual make more or less than $50,000?\" we poll all of the small decision makers and weight them based on how much they know.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one of our decision makers might be very good at predicting if education affects income, and the other might be very good at predicting if capital gain or loss affects income, while another might only be ok at predicting if age affects income. We assign each of these smaller decision makers a weight based on their accuracy, and use that to find a weighted average of all of their predictions. That weighted average is our final prediction.\n",

In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

Apart from occupation not showing up, I'm surprised to see that capital loss has a higher importance than capital gain. This could perhaps be explained by having enough capital to experience a high capital loss is indicative of making a higher salary."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
